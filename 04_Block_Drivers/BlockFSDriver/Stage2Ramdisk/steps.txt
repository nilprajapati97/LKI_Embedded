Assignment #02

Part #1
a. Complete the TODOs in the file ram_block.c in here.
b. Compile the dor.ko driver by typing "make".
c. Load the driver dor.ko using "insmod dor.ko".
d. Checkout the automatically created block device files (/dev/rb*). /dev/rb is the entire disk of 512 KiB size. rb1,
rb2, rb3 are the primary partitions with rb2 being the extended partition and containing the 3 logical partitions rb5,
rb6, rb7.
e. Display the ramdisk partitions using "fdisk -l /dev/rb".
f. Read the entire disk (/dev/rb) using the disk dump utility dd.
g. Zero out the first sector of the disk’s first partition (/dev/rb1) again using dd.
h. Write some text into the disk’s first partition (/dev/rb1) using cat.
   + cat > /dev/rb1
i Display the initial contents of the first partition (/dev/rb1) using the xxd utility.
  + xxd /dev/rb1 | less
j Format the third primary partition (/dev/rb3) as vfat filesystem (like your pen drive), using mkfs.vfat
  + mkfs.vfat /dev/rb3
  Mount the newly formatted partition using mount, say at /mnt and Use Disk usage utility df to see this partition mounted at /mnt
  + mount -t vfat /dev/rb3 /mnt
  You may go ahead and store your files there. But, please remember that these partitions are all on a disk on RAM, and so non-persistent.
  Hence, Unloading the driver using ‘rmmod dor‘ would vanish everything. Though the partition needs to be unmounted using ‘umount /mnt‘ before
  doing that.

Part #2
a. Change code to achieve the following:
	+ Disk on RAM of size of 1MiB
	+ Disk to have the same geometry as in Assignment #01
b. Re-compile the dor.ko driver by typing "make".
c. Re-load the driver dor.ko using "insmod dor.ko", after unloading the previous one using "rmmod dor"
d. Display the ramdisk partitions using "fdisk -l -u /dev/rb".
